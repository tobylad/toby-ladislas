I was that kid trying to beat Sonic the Hedgehog 2 all summer; that teenager who helped pioneer the art of secretly texting in class; that adult saying 'Why doesn't this website work better?'  Somewhere along the line, I decided it would be best to just learn how to tell computers what to do.              

  I have experienced with Ruby on Rails, ES6 JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, React.js, PHP, and Laravel. I take pride in good Git workflow and clean, human-readable code.

  My personal interests heavily influence what coding projects I like to work on during my spare time, and those include motorcycles, progressive rock music, karaoke, and sports.",

Post.create(title: "How Did I Get Here?", 

            body: "First off, where is ‘here’ - or more accurately -  when?  It’s two months out of coding bootcamp, and eight months after closing the book on my teaching career.  Now that I think about it, this whole process actually started way back in 2006, when I decided to become a teacher in the first place.

My reasoning behind the choice was barely reason at all: Mostly everyone I knew was going into education, so I figured at least I’d know some people (and summers off didn’t hurt).  I went with high school English, because it’s what I was best at.  Though I did well in my courses, the only excitement I remember from that major was when we acted out Shakespeare ‘in a modern lens.’  

Maybe it was that lack of excitement, a network in the wrong subject areas, or just plain bad luck, but with the exception of student teaching in 2010, I never taught a day of English.  My first full-time teaching job was in Physical Education, something I had zero formal training in.  I had volunteer coached volleyball for about five years at that point, so I banked on that experience as much as I could.  Though I wasn’t perfect (and realized that even the best-trained teachers aren’t either), I succeeded.  I taught my students some new sports, how to work as a team, and realized I myself have quite an uncanny ability to learn things on the fly.  It took me four years to realize it, but this habit of learning would become a trend.

Last June, I made a risky decision to continue that trend - to leave a steady position and go learn to do something I’ve never done before: Computer programming.  This time, I also had a reason: Technology is everywhere.  In becoming a software engineer, then, it means I can go anywhere, and work in any field, really.  It gives incredible flexibility but also limitless learning potential.  It can change lives.  So I enrolled in a 6-month program to learn full-stack web development.  And long story short, 8 months ago I had ‘kinda heard of HTML,’ and now I’m able to build entire websites from the ground up, like the one you’re on right now.  

I’d consider that life-changing for sure.",

Post.create(title: "Closing Time", 

  body: "This week, I want to go a little more in depth about my bootcamp experience.

From June until December 2017, I was a student at the now-defunct Dev Bootcamp Chicago.  The decision to go there wasn’t a last-second one; I had given much time and thought to my decision to leave a steady teaching career.  I had looked into other programs, most of which sent me weekly e-mails and popped up in ads saying the usual tagline of “Make $80k your first year” and so on.  But from DBC, there weren’t any e-mails or ads.  It was through word of mouth (now I get why jobs are landed through referrals more often than cold applications).  Hearing that their graduates were successful from someone I trust was really all I needed.  So after some planning and many hours of thinking, I went for it, and my career transformation began.

The format was 9 weeks of remote work, and 9-15 more onsite.  The first few weeks started with some basics: HTML, CSS, Git, and preliminary engineering empathy curriculum work.  Though I didn’t become an expert in that time, I remember feeling very confident and strong in my ability to do this, given that I had zero experience coming in.

Then, in week 4, two major bombshells hit.  First, I had to learn a back-end programming language, and think in ways I never have before.  The second: Dev Bootcamp was closing its doors at the end of the year.  Say what?  

All the time spent in thought and research, tuition already fully paid, life about to change - could it still happen?  How would this closing affect me?  Is it going to screw me over come job-search time?  Will the instructors be too preoccupied with finding something else to care that I’m learning?  Did I make a mistake coming here?

Throughout the rest of the program, I surely made many mistakes - what better way to learn?  But when it comes to the concerns I had, I’m glad to say they weren’t an issue.  The constant ‘fire-hose’ of new material gave my brain room for little else.  My instructors and mentors poured everything they had into making sure the last few cohorts got the guaranteed life change they expected.  Most of all, the pressure my cohort-mates and I constantly faced gave us a more unique experience than most.  We had a saying that the greater Chicagoland area has ‘last call on DBC grads’, and I’m pumped to be a part of that.",
