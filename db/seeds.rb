I was that kid trying to beat Sonic the Hedgehog 2 all summer; that teenager with an 8-pound Nokia phone in my pocket I shared with my brother; that adult saying 'Why doesn't this website work better?'  Somewhere along the line, I decided it would be best to just learn how to tell computers what to do.              

  I am experienced in Ruby on Rails, ES6 JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and React. I take pride in good Git workflow and clean, human-readable code.

  My personal interests heavily influence what coding projects I like to work on during my spare time, and those include motorcycles, progressive rock music, karaoke, and playing sports.",

Post.create(title: "How Did I Get Here?", 

            body: "First off, where is ‘here’ - or more accurately -  when?  It’s two months out of coding bootcamp, and eight months after closing the book on my teaching career.  Now that I think about it, this whole process actually started way back in 2006, when I decided to become a teacher in the first place.

My reasoning behind the choice was barely reason at all: Mostly everyone I knew was going into education, so I figured at least I’d know some people (and summers off didn’t hurt).  I went with high school English, because it’s what I was best at.  Though I did well in my courses, the only excitement I remember from that major was when we acted out Shakespeare ‘in a modern lens.’  

Maybe it was that lack of excitement, a network in the wrong subject areas, or just plain bad luck, but with the exception of student teaching in 2010, I never taught a day of English.  My first full-time teaching job was in Physical Education, something I had zero formal training in.  I had volunteer coached volleyball for about five years at that point, so I banked on that experience as much as I could.  Though I wasn’t perfect (and realized that even the best-trained teachers aren’t either), I succeeded.  I taught my students some new sports, how to work as a team, and realized I myself have quite an uncanny ability to learn things on the fly.  It took me four years to realize it, but this habit of learning would become a trend.

Last June, I made a risky decision to continue that trend - to leave a steady position and go learn to do something I’ve never done before: Computer programming.  This time, I also had a reason: Technology is everywhere.  In becoming a software engineer, then, it means I can go anywhere, and work in any field, really.  It gives incredible flexibility but also limitless learning potential.  It can change lives.  So I enrolled in a 6-month program to learn full-stack web development.  And long story short, 8 months ago I had ‘kinda heard of HTML,’ and now I’m able to build entire websites from the ground up, like the one you’re on right now.  

I’d consider that life-changing for sure.",
